overview:
- You will be tasked with creating a frontend and backend app that lets users manage a playlist of songs


- The frontend will display the songs and let users create new songs and update/delete existing songs


- The backend will store the songs data, serve the frontend code, and provide API endpoints for manipulating the songs data

- create the repo and set up the app structure. Copy from the repo above!


- your server should have a fully functional backend with a model, controllers, and endpoints for performing the 5 CRUD Get All, Get One, Create, Update, Delete


- your frontend should be able to make these requests to the backend and render the songs in a list
Remember, a server application is mostly “boilerplate” (it’s the same every time) so feel free to copy the example applications in the notes and refactor them to suit your needs. Refactoring is the real challenge here, not creating from scratch. (edited)
